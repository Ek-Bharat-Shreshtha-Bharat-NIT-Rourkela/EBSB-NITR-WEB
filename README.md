## **Contribution Guidelines:**

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

#### We Use the fork-and-pull method, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo to your account.
2. clone the repo into your local directory using **git clone** in your git bash.
3. Make your changes and test it locally on your code editor
4. **commit** your changes and **push** your work back to your fork
5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes.
